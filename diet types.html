            <img src="images/healthydiet2.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 300px; border-radius: 150px;">
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: garamond; font-size: 20px;">A diet known as the Mediterranean
                Diet places a strong emphasis on
                plant-based meals and healthy fats. If
                you follow this diet type you need to consume lots of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, lentils, beans
                and nuts. There should be a lot of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) as a healthy fat source. A reasonable
                amount of fish, especially omega-3-rich fish is important. Also other important points are; choosing
                poultry over red meat, eating little to no meat. Little to no butter, sugary beverages, or dessert and
                modest wine consumption with meals. Depending on your medical history, underlying diseases, allergies,

            <h2>Unhealthy Diets</h2>
            <h3>Water Diet/Water Fasting</h3>
            <img src="images/unhealthydiet1.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 300px; border-radius: 150px;">
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: garamond; font-size: 20px;">The fact that the body burns extra
                calories to balance the temperature of the water when drinking cold
                water has made the water diet more preferable for those who want to lose weight. It is a type of diet
                that is frequently preferred by those who want to lose weight fast, and it gives effective results when
                applied correctly, and it can also cause harm when used incorrectly. The water diet is a type of diet
                that creates a detox effect for the body by consuming plenty of water and liquid beverages and provides
                weight loss by increasing calorie burning. Excess fluid consumption may increase kidney stone formation
                as it will adversely affect kidney functions. The water diet has many harms, especially in long-term
                use. It can cause low blood pressure and nausea as it can cause blood sugar levels to drop. Because the
                body's nutritional needs are not met adequately, it can cause fainting, hair loss, loss of coordination,
                strength and endurance. May cause irregular eating habits in those with eating disorders.</p>
            <h3>No Sugar Diet</h4>
                <img src="images/unhealthydiet2.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 300px; border-radius: 150px;">
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: garamond; font-size: 20px;">A sugar-free diet, commonly
                    referred
                    to as a no-sugar diet, limits additional sugar. However, this is not
                    typically advised as part of a healthy, balanced diet. More extreme variants of a no sugar diet may
                    include exclude items with naturally occurring sugar, such as fruits and vegetables. Despite
                    official
                    guidelines to cut back on the quantity of sugar you add to food and your consumption of sweetened
                    beverages and foods, it is unrealistic and unhealthy to completely cut out sugar and carbohydrates
                    from
                    your diet. You run the danger of anemia and constipation, as well as feeling tired and short on
                    energy,
                    if you avoid starchy carbohydrates. Your bones may be at danger of osteoporosis if you stop eating
                    dairy
                    products without replacing them with calcium rich alternatives. We also know that eating five
                    servings
                    of a variety of fruits and vegetables each day is beneficial for heart health and cancer prevention,
                    so
                    avoiding fruit is not a good choice.</p>
